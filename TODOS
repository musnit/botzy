volume sucks. maybe use volume converted to usd or some other activity measure, ie, can i pull the maker trade off or not?
some kinda group by to see core edge/edges that are unlocking the trade
fix sort/filter performance, ie can filter just once on filter change, not every time new data is in (at least on data that does not change, like source/target/exchange/maker/...) and then can sort only on filtered out cycles
maybe can hardcode 'active pairs that are makerable'
for maker, should bot pop up to top of order book by +1 ing?
filter in/out can drop/start subscription
dont need to be limited to making orders at the top of the order book's value. could make an order a little lower/higher under presumption that someone will dig past the top orders into yours.
dedup edges not only on duplicate cycles, but also on no cycles with overlapping edges shown on screen at once (maybe)
move filters out to filter system, defaulting to filter out low volume and maker
fix dup loops
perf improves
render refreshes naturally, maybe change to redux/denormalized setState?
heartbeat icons/colors/animation working fine
filters on cycles can be used to filter in/out cross exchange, maker, etc
add default filter of skip single-exchange t-t and t-m
make it handle fees, maker/taker, and then maybe cross-exchange fee heuristic
play/explore maker feasibility
history!
make next todos
